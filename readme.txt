WP Customer Reviews allows your customers and visitors to leave reviews or testimonials of your services. Reviews are Microformat enabled (hReview).

== Description ==

There are many sites that are crawling for user-generated reviews now, including Google Places and Google Local Search. WP Customer Reviews allows you to setup a specific page on your blog to receive customer testimonials.

* All submissions are moderated, which means that YOU choose which reviews get shown.
* Reviews are displayed to visitors in a friendly format, but search engines see the hReview microformat (and RDFa soon!)
* Multiple anti-spam measures to prevent automated spambots from submitting reviews.
* Provides a configurable `Business hCard`, to help identify all pages of your site as belonging to your business.
